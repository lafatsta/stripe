I have developed a customer-facing eCommerce application where a user would be able to:

Add items, with the intent to purchase, into a Checkout cart
Using Stripe’s Integration, a user can checkout and pay for the items in their Checkout Cart
Receive a success page stating the total amount charged in the purchase and paymentIntent ID for their records.

The eCommerce application is developed in Node.js, leveraging popular industry frameworks and technologies such as MongoDB, Express and Pug. The Stripe eCommerce application demonstrates the  straight-through workflow of a customer’s unique eCommerce application with the integration of Stripe’s Checkout API.
